# yolov5-dnn
This example demonstrates how to perform inference using YOLOv5 in C++ with OpenCV's API.

It's based on ultralytics YOLOv5: https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5.

This project supports inference of Object Detection and Instance Segmentation with onnx model(static model).

# Runtime Environment
Opencv = opencv-4.8.0
